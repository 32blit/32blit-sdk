# Building & Running On 32blit

To build your project for 32blit using arm-none-eabi-gcc you should prepare the Makefile with CMake using the provided toolchain file.

From the root of your project:

```
cmake . -B build.stm32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../32blit.toolchain
make -C build.stm32
```

The result of your build will be a `.bin`, `.hex`, `.elf` and DfuSe-compatible `.dfu` file.

## Uploading to the 32blit via DFU

### Prepare the device

To enter DFU mode either hold the X & Y buttons and press the reset button or select `dfu mode` from the on device menu. The screen will go dark, this is normal.

### Linux and macOS

Install `dfu-util` from your package manager then enter:
```
sudo dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D
```

Followed by the name of the .bin file that you just built.

## Troubleshooting

If you see `cannot create target because another target with the same name already exists` you've probably run `cmake ..` in the wrong directory (the project directory rather than the build directory), you should remove all but your project files and `cmake ..` again from the build directory.

If you have more than one device in DFU mode connected to your computer then find the 32blit using `lsusb` and add `-d vid:pid` to the dfu-util command. Replace `vid:pid` with the 4 character ID strings to target the correct device.
