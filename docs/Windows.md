# Building & Running on Win32 (WSL or MinGW)

## Setting things up

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

To enable Windows Subsystem for Linux, you must access the _Turn Windows features on or off_ dialog. Find the entry for _Windows Subsystem for Linux_ and make sure it is enabled.

After that, proceed to the Microsoft Store to download Ubuntu for WSL.

### Installing requirements inside WSL

Install all the requirements using _apt_ and _pip3_ inside Ubuntu WSL:

```shell
sudo apt install gcc gcc-arm-none-eabi cmake make python3 python3-pip
pip3 install construct bitstring
```

If you want to deploy to the device, you will also need to download a DFU tool. On Windows it's easiest to just use "DfuSe Demonstration" (available from [st.com](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html))

### XMing

To run the examples from WSL on Windows you will need to have XMing (or another XWindow Server) running on Windows. Click on the following link which will help you install and setup WSL and XMing together.

- [Information how to run XMing with WSL](https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2017/02/08/graphical-programs-on-windows-subsystem-on-linux.aspx)
- [XMing homepage](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/)
- Direct link to [download XMing setup](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files/Xming/6.9.0.31/Xming-6-9-0-31-setup.exe/download)

You can then run code by either:
- prefixing the command with `DISPLAY=:0.0`, or 
- execute the command `export DISPLAY=:0.0` - which after you will not need to prefix the commands in the current session, just run them

## Build

The following sections contain information on how to build and run example projects.

### Building & Running on Linux or WSL + XMing

To build your project for testing, go into the relevant example directory. We'll use `palette-cycle` to demonstrate:

```
cd examples/palette-cycle
```

prepare the Makefile with CMake:

```
cmake . -B build
```

and compile the example:

```
make -C build
```

To run the application on your computer, use the following command (from within the same directory):

```
./palette-cycle
```

If you're using WSL and XMing you will need to add a `DISPLAY` variable like so:

```
DISPLAY=:0.0 ./palette-cycle
```

### Building & Running on Win32 (WSL + MinGW)

To build your project for Win32 you'll need `g++-mingw-w64` and `g++-mingw-w64`.

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64 g++-mingw-w64
```

You'll also need to cross-compile SDL2 and install it wherever you like to keep your cross-compile libraries.

```
wget https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.10.zip
unzip SDL2-2.0.10.zip
cd SDL2-2.0.10
mkdir build.mingw
cd build.mingw
../configure --target=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --build=x86_64--linux --prefix=/usr/local/cross-tools/x86_64-w64-mingw32/
make
sudo make install
```

Finally, from the root directory of your project:

```
cmake . -B build.mingw -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../mingw.toolchain -DSDL2_DIR=/usr/local/cross-tools/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/cmake/SDL2
make -C build.mingw
cp /usr/local/cross-tools/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/SDL2.dll .
```

### Troubleshooting

If you see `cannot create target because another target with the same name already exists` you've probably run `cmake ..` in the wrong directory (the project directory rather than the build directory), you should remove all but your project files and `cmake ..` again from the build directory.
